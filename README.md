# Hangman Helper
Hangman Helper is an assistant for the person holding a hangman word that others are trying to guess. Enter the word and the letters guessed so far, and it gives you back the text to tell other players.

Modified for the use of [Discordian Alley (Hogwarts)](https://discord.gg/tfdAD9rwv8) Discord server's minigames. Not affiliated.

It has controls to adjust font size, which it remembers for your next visit.

It also remembers the word and guesses. Unfortunately, that means it doesn't handle participating in more than one game at once, unless you use a separate copy for each one.

## Use
It's live <a href="https://lightningbolt62.github.io/HangmanHelper/">here</a>.

You can also download it and run it from a local hard drive. No installation needed, just grab the files, and double click index.html.
